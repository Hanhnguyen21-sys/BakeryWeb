# Responsive Website Project

This is my first experience building a website after 2 weeks learning HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, etc on Youtube. I want to build up a small practical project to get hands-on experience. 111 Bakery is one of my favorite bakeries nearby my house, but they do not have a webiste when I google it. Therefore, I come up with an idea developing the website for the store.
